Airport Weather Server

Yet another Spring/Hibernate CRUD tomcat server ;)

The idea is to expose several APIs to collect weather data from weather reporting machines inside airports all around the world.

Beside the standard APIs exposed by Spring Data JPA, there are user specific interfaces including:
1. Specific CRUD APIs for ariports
2. Get statistics
3. Get weather data using airport and surrounding radius
